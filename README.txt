# Email Spam Classifier

This project is a simple email spam classifier built using Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit. The application allows users to classify emails as spam or non-spam using a Naive Bayes model.

## Features
- Train a Naive Bayes model on sample email data.
- Evaluate model accuracy and performance.
- Input a custom email to classify it as spam or non-spam.
- Interactive user interface using Streamlit.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-spam-classifier.git
   cd email-spam-classifier
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run email_spam_classifier.py
   ```

## Requirements

## Usage

1. Launch the app using the above command.
2. View the sample dataset and the model evaluation metrics on the homepage.
3. Test the classifier by entering your own email in the input box.
4. The app will predict whether the email is spam or non-spam.

## Dataset
The application uses a small sample dataset for demonstration purposes. Replace this with a larger, real-world dataset for better performance.
